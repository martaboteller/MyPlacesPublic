# MyPlaces App

This is the final project of a course entitled <i>IOS Application Developer</i> carried out at the UOC university thanks to a 
grant from the Generalitat of Catalonia and the European Union.

The initial idea of this app has been created by the course organizers. Based on that initial idea I have created my own verion of MyPlacess app. 

With this application a registered user can save preferred places and their info (name, description, type, localization and image). Places can be displayed as a table or distributed on a map. In addition, an image can be saved for each place. 

An administrator view with the user's information will be added in further deliveries of this project.

### Accessing the App

Firebase has been used as a backend connection to store user's data. Two possible ways to access the app: as a registered user and as a guest. But only registered users can save, edit and remove places.

On the image below, a registered user can access MyPlaces app (center), a new registration can be done (left) and a lost password can be retreived (right).

All functions related to Firebase will be found at file <i>PlaceServices.swift</i>.
