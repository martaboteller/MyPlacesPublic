// Do you see those MARK lines there in the code? They do nothing (of course, they are comments
// after all). But that special syntax let you define some nice sections in the header.
// Have a look at the bar at the top of this code file. You should see something like...
// MyPlaces > MyPlaces > PlaceManager.swift > No Selection
// Click on the last element and you will get a drop down list from which you can navigate to any
// method in current file. Those MARK lines let you specify some sections to group related methods.

    // MARK: - Singleton
    
    // Nothing fancy here.
    // This is just a different way to create a Singleton.
    // But it's basically the same you just saw
    // in the sample code. Now you know two slightly different ways to do the same.

    // decide to use some other data structure, we'll only need to change the implementation for
